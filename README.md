# XC-Simulation-Study
This is a project that is did for STAT 321: Statistical Computation and Simulation. In it, I worked with my collaborator, Akhil Ghosh, on looking at different scoring methods in how often they result in violations of the independence of irrelevant alternatives. We would like to extend this project further by using empirical data from past NCAA D1 Cross Country Championships.
